# StartGUI Description
This code shows the first steps in creating a graphical user interface (GUI) that can be built upon to create complex relationships for a mechanical plush toy.

# In This Repo:
In this repo you will find:
1. WorkingCode Directory: This directory has the working elements of the code as it is. It contains two .js files (moodActions.js & sketch.js), one HTML file (index.html), and one CSS file (style.css)
2. TestCode Directory: This directory has the test codes that haven't worked yet, or we haven't fully enabled. It contains two .js files (moodActionsTest.js & sketchTest.js), one HTML file (indexTest.html), and one CSS file (styleTest.css)

#### Working Code Elements:
1. A canvas with a sidebar where you can choose from multiple shapes
2. 2 icons that show the shape that will be drawn on the canvas
3. A trashcan icon that isn't fully enabled yet

#### Working Code Properties/Actions:
1. When you click the icon on the sidebar, shapes appear
2. When the mouse rolls over the shape, it changes color
3. When you click on the shape, you can drag it to another position

# Next Steps:
1. Enable the trash can/clear button
2. Figure out how to connect shapes using a line
3. Figure out how to get shapes to stop moving
4. Find out how to call the new "tied shapes" so that we can enable them in the backend
5. Tie the backend code and GUI to mechanical sensors

# Installation Instructions:
1. Open the [P5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) or your IDE of choice.
2. Make sure you have multiple files created (HTML, CSS, JS), P5.js will already have three of these.
3. Make an additional P5.js file titled "MoodActions.js"
4. Take each file in this repo and copy them to the corresponding files in the editor
5. Make sure you copy either the working script or test script, depending on which you are trying to work on.
